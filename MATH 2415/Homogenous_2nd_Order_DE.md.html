**Homogenous 2nd Order Differential Equations**

# Homogenous 2nd Order Differential Equations

## Theorems

!!! theorem: Theorem: 3.2.1 Existence and Uniqueness Theorem
    Considering the following intial value problems,
    $$
        \begin{equation}
        y'' + p(t)y' + q(t)y = g(t), \space y(t_0) = y_0, \space y'(t_0) = y'_0
        \end{equation}
    $$
    where $p$, $q$, and $g$ are continuous on the domain, $T$, that includes $t_0$. This problem must have exactly one solution, $y=\phi(t)$, which exists on the same domain as $T$.

    This theorem is extremely important. It highlights the fact that all of our IVPs in this form *must* have a solution.

!!! theorem: Theorem 3.2.2 Principle of Superposition
    If $y_1$ and $y_2$ are solutions to the differential equation, 
    $$
        \begin{equation}
        L[y] = y'' + y(t)y' + q(t)y = 0
        \end{equation}
    $$
    then the linear combination $c_1y_1 + c_2y_2$ is also a solution for any values of the constants $c_1$ and $c_2$

## Homogenous Differential Equations

A homogenous differential equation is one that has a form of the following:

$$
    P(t)y'' + Q(t)y' + R(t)y = 0
$$

where $P$, $Q$, and $R$ are all continuous functions. For now we are only looking at the simplified version of this equation, where the three functions are constants.

$$
    \begin{equation}
    ay'' + by' + cy = 0
    \end{equation}
$$

We wish to find a general way to solve equations in this form. To start, we make an educated guess and assume our solutions is in the form of $y = e^{rt}$. This solution and its derivatives are then plugged into the equation (3) above, leaving us with the following:

$$
    \begin{equation}
    (ar^2 + br + c)e^{rt} = 0
    \end{equation}
$$

This equation is only true when the left side is zero and/or $e^{rt}=0$, therefore the following equation is left:

$$
    \begin{equation}
    ar^2 + br + c = 0
    \end{equation}
$$

Equation (5) is named the **characteristic equation** of the differential equation. The roots of this equation are the values for the solution. Since this equation is a quadratic, we know that the roots can be real, complex, or repeated (two similar solutions). Given these three possibilities, we have different ways of finding the general solution.

All of the solutions make use of Theorem 3.2.2, meaning we take two solutions $y_1$ and $y_2$, and given two arbitray constants (based on the IVP), solve the given equation:

$$
    \begin{equation}
    y = \phi(t) = c_1y_1 + c_2y_2
    \end{equation}
$$

where $\phi(t)$ is the general solution for the equation.

## The Wronskian

The Wronskian is a way of determining if a set of equations has a unique solution. It is computed by finding the determinant of a given system of equations:

Given a system in the form of the following:

$$
    \begin{equation}
    c_1y_1 + c_2y_2 = y_0 \\
    c_1y'_1 + c_2y'_2 = y'_0
    \end{equation}
$$

the determinant can be calculated like this:

$$
    W = 
    \begin{vmatrix}
    y_1 & y_2 \\
    y'_1 & y'_2
    \end{vmatrix}
    = y_1y'_2 - y_2y'_1
$$

If $W \not = 0$, then there must be a unique solution to the problem.


!!! theorem: Theorem 3.2.6
    If a 2nd Order Linear differential equation in the form of (1) has a solution in the form of $y=u(t)+iv(t)$, then its real part $u$ and its imaginary part $v$, must both be solutions to the differential equation. This is due to the law of superposition (3.2.2)

    This theorem then relates to how we solve for 2nd Order Homogenous DEs with complex roots. Rather than using both of the roots to find the general solution, you can instead just use one of the roots, and its real and imaginary part. The answer is the same as if you used both of the roots.



## Summary

Given the general form of a Homogenous 2nd Order Linear Differential Equation:
$$
    ay'' + by' + cy = 0
$$

We can solve for the general solution in multiple different ways given we know the value of certain equations:

Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the roots of the characteristic equation:

$$
    ar^2+br+c=0
$$

and the determinant be the following:

$$
    b^2 - 4ac
$$

If $r_1$ and $r_2$ are not equal and are real, or the determinant is positive:

$$
    y = c_1 e^{r_1 t} + c_2 e^{r_2 t}
$$

If $r_1$ and $r_2$ are complex conjugates, or the determinant is negative:

$$
    \begin{aligned}
    &e^{\lambda + i \mu} = e^{\lambda t}(\cos(\mu t) + i\sin(\mu t)) \\
    \space \\
    &y = c_1 e^{\lambda t}\cos(\mu t) + c_2 e^{\lambda t}\sin(\mu t)
    \end{aligned}
$$

If $r_1$ and $r_2$ are equal, or the determinant is zero:

$$
    y = c_1 e^{r_1 t} + c_2 t e^{r_1 t}
$$
