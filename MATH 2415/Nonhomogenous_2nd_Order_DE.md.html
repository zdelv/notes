<h1 class="title">Nonhomogenous 2nd Order Differential Equations</h1>
</header>
<p>An equation in the form below is what is called a <strong>nonhomogenous</strong> 2nd order linear differential equation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math display">\[
 L[y] = y&#39;&#39; + p(t)y&#39; + q(t)y = g(t)
\]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(p(t)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(q(t)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(g(t)\)</span> are all continous functions on the interval <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>.</p>
<p>For the equation above, if it is written where <span class="math inline">\(g(t)=0\)</span>, for all t, then this equation is the <strong>homogenous</strong> form for the given nonhomogenous differential equation:</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><span class="math display">\[
 L[y] = y&#39;&#39; + p(t)y&#39; + q(t)y = 0
\]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>We also know given our knowledge of linear systems of equations, that if <span class="math inline">\(Y_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_2\)</span> are solutions to the nonhomogenous linear differential equation (1), then their difference <span class="math inline">\(Y_1 - Y_2\)</span> is a solution to the corresponding linear system of equation (2). In addition, we also know that <span class="math inline">\(Y_1 - Y_2 = c_1y_1(t)+c_2y_2(t)\)</span>, given that <span class="math inline">\(y_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_2\)</span> form the fundamental set of solutions for equation (2).</p>
<p>Given in other words, the previous paragraph describes that the nonhomogenous equation can directly relate to the homogenous equation and its solutions through simple linear combonations of their solutions. If you have two solutions to the nonhomogenous differential equation, then you can find the fundamental solution to the corresponding homogenous differential equation.</p>
<p>The general (fundamental) solution to the nonhomogenous differential equation (1) is the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ 
    y = \phi(t) = c_1y_1(t)+c_2y_2(t) + Y(t)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(y_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_2\)</span> form the fundamental set of solutions for the corresponding homogenous equation (2), <span class="math inline">\(c_n\)</span> are arbitrary constants, and <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> is any solution to the nonhomogenous equation (1).</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="summary-of-the-above">Summary of the above</h4>
<p>With all of the work described above, we arrive at the general way we solve nonhomogenous differential equations in the form of equation (1):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Find the general solution <span class="math inline">\(c_1y_1 + c_2y_2\)</span> of the corresponding homogenous equation (2). This solution is called the <strong>complementary solution</strong>, denoted as <span class="math inline">\(y_c(t)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Find any solution <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> of the nonhomogenous equation (1). This solution is called the <strong>particular solution</strong>.</li>
<li>Form the sum of the functions from 1 and 2 to satsify the general form written above</li>
</ol>
<p>The ways of finding <span class="math inline">\(y_c(t)\)</span> are general with the way to solve homogenous equations, so that will not be discussed here. Instead, we focus on the nonhomogenous solution, step 2.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="finding-the-nonhomogenous-solution-yt">2. Finding the nonhomogenous solution, <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span></h2>
<p>The two methods for finding nonhomogenous solutions mentioned here are the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The method of undetermined coefficients (Section 3.5)</li>
<li>The method of variation of parameters (Section 3.6)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-method-of-undetermined-coefficents">The Method of Undetermined Coefficents</h3>
<p>The method of undetermined coefficents is mostly a “guess-and-check” type of solution, where to find <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span>, we make an assumption on the general form for <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> and leave the coefficents unspecified. We then substitute this <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> into the given nonhomogenous equation in the form of equation (1) and attempt to determine the coefficents that satisfy the equation. If we cannot find coefficents that satisfy the equation, then we must find a new general form for <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> and try again.</p>
<p>This method uses mostly brute force and domain knowledge to find a solution, so it’s restricted to equations that have relatively simple makeup.</p>
<hr />
<h5 id="example">Example:</h5>
<p>Find a particular solution of:</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><span class="math display">\[
 y&#39;&#39; - 3y&#39; - 4y = 3e^{2t}
\]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> we choose to start with is an exponential, as this is a common form for generic <span class="math inline">\(y^{(n)} = g(t)\)</span> differential equations. We can also notice that taking the derivative of equation (3) returns an exponential each time, which should clue us into what the <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> form looks like.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><span class="math display">\[
 Y(t) = Ae^{2t}
\]</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Equation (4) is then subtituted into Equation (3), given the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    Y&#39;(t) = 2Ae^{2t}, \space \space Y&#39;&#39;(t) = 4Ae^{2t}
\]</span></p>
<p>The obtained equation after substituing the given differentials in is the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    Y&#39;&#39;-3Y&#39;-4Y=(4A-6A-4A)e^{2t}=3e^{2t} \\
    -6Ae^{2t} = 3e^{2t}
\]</span></p>
<p>Given the above equation, we can notice that the only value for A that satisfies it is when <span class="math inline">\(A = -\frac{1}{2}\)</span>, therefore the following solution is achieved:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
    Y(t) = -\frac{1}{2}e^{2t}
\]</span></p>
<hr />
<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p>To solve a nonhomogenous 2nd order differential equation in the form of equation (1), complete the following steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Find the general solution to the corresponding homogenous differential equation in the form of equation (2)</li>
<li>Ensure that the equation has only sinusoidal functions, exponentials, polynomials, or any sums or products of the preceeding functions. If not, then use the method of variation of parameters.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(g(t)\)</span> can be split into <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> individual terms - or written as <span class="math inline">\(\sum{g_n(t)}\)</span> - split the problem into <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> subproblems, each of which have the following form: <span class="math display">\[
 ay&#39;&#39; + by&#39; + cy = g_i(t)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> runs from 1 to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</li>
<li>Assume <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> has the equivalent general form for the <span class="math inline">\(g(t)\)</span> given, following Table 4 below:</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span> is the same as the solution to the homogenous differential equation, then add an extra <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> term to <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span>. If this does not fix the error, raise the power of the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> term added (eg <span class="math inline">\(t^n \rightarrow t^{n+1}\)</span>)</li>
<li>If the problem was split into subproblems, solve for each <span class="math inline">\(Y_i(t)\)</span> and add them together to form the particular solution to the nonhomogenous equation.</li>
<li>Given your particular solution, <span class="math inline">\(Y(t)\)</span>, and the solution to the homogenous equation, <span class="math inline">\(c_1y_1 + c_2y_2\)</span>, form the nonhomogenous general solution: <span class="math display">\[
 \phi(t) = c_1y_1 + c_2y_2 + Y(t)
\]</span></li>
<li>Any remaining arbitrary constants can now be solved for using the initial conditions provided.</li>
