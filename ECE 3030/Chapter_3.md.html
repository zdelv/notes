**Chapter 3 - Energy Bands and Charge Carriers**

# Energy Bands

The repetitive nature of the lattice structure in semiconductors changes how the wavefunction for a free particle acts, giving rise to a band structure throughout the medium. This band structure can be thought of as a continuous "band" of $N$ electron states that are formed from each addtional atom added to the lattice. Continually adding more of these atoms 

This structure can be found by looking at how the electrons in a quantum well are confined to specfic energy states $n$, based on the following eqauation:

$$
    E_n = \hbar \omega_n = \frac{\hbar^2 n^2 \pi^2}{2mL}
$$

As $n \rightarrow \infty$, a continuous *band* is created, where the $n$ value can vary greatly, allowing many electrons to exist simultaneously in a close area.

![Si Energy Band Graph](Chapter_3/Si_Energy_Band_Graph.png)

The above graph shows how these bands are formed. The $x$ axis is the atomic spacing, $a$, and the $y$ axis is the energy an electron could have given that atomic spacing. As the spacing increases, we approach discrete energy levels, which are represented by the single lines coming from the right axis. As the spacing is decreased, the effect described above begins to occur, and the possible energy levels increase quickly. This causes the discrete energy level to form into *bands*, where an electron could have any energy level within that band. At the actual spacing, which is marked in the diagram, we can see the appearence of the *conduction* band, *valence* band and their respective energy band gap, $E_g$.

## Metals, Semiconductors, and Insulators
The three materials when it comes to the topics of bonds and conductivity are metals, semiconductors, and insulators.

Metals are characterised by their metallic bonding and their "sea of electrons" where excess electrons not used between bonding exist. The band structure of a metal will either have the valence and conduction bands partially overlapping or the conduction band will be partially filled. This causes the electrons to easily flow in an applied electric field and is why metals commonly are great conductors.

Semiconductors on the other hand, have distinctly split valence and conduction bands, with all electrons existing in the valence band at 0K. At higher temperatures, (like room temperature, 293K) electrons have enough kinetic energy to move out of the valence band and into the conduction band. The amount of electrons that are able to jump bands is based on the band gap, $E_g$ of the semiconductor. This characteristic is why semiconductors are commonly used for very precise electronics, like microprocessors. We can tune the conductivity of the material given doping and other thermal or optical operating conditions.

Insulators are related to semiconductors in that they also have distinctly split valence and conduction bands, but their difference exists from the size of the band gap. For insulators, the band gap is much larger, which greatly increases the amount of energy needed for electrons to jump bands. With very few electrons in the conduction band and very few holes in the valence band, current does not flow easily through an insulator.

The image below demonstrates concepts mentioned above.

![Metal Band Comparison](Chapter_3/Insulators_Semiconductors_Metals_Band_Comparison.png)

## Direct and Indirect Semiconductors
Continuing with our discussion on energy bands within semiconductors, we arrive at an important concept about direct and indirect semiconductors.

Below is a simplified graph of the band structure for GaAs and AlAs. The upside-down parabola at the bottom of the picture is the valence band, while the three bands above are all apart of the conduction band, but just at different minimums across the entire band.

![E-K Graph](Chapter_3/GaAs-AlAs_E-K_Graph.png)

For an electron to move from the valence band in GaAs, we notice that there is a *direct* path for it to move in, with a relatively low band gap energy, compared to AlAs. A direct semiconductor has this vertical characteristic and in general has lower band gaps. 

The lowest conduction band energy for AlAs is shown to the +$k$ direction from the highest point of the valence band. This causes electrons to have an *indirect* path between the conduction band and the valence band, and thus, a higher band gap energy. An indirect semiconductor does not have a direct movement from the conduction band to valence band which increases the energy band gap. There needs to be other structure or helping mechanisms to move electrons from the conduction band to the valence band or vice versa.

*Side Note:*
The mathematics for this phenomenon is the following. Given the form for a wavevector in a lattice:
$$
    \Psi_\mathbf{k}(x) = U(\mathbf{k}_x, x)e^{j\mathbf{k}_xx} \\
    \space \\
    \mathbf{k}_x = \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}
$$
where $\mathbf{k}_x$ is the wavevector for the wave, describing the direction and speed of the wave in multi-dimensional space. $U(\mathbf{k}_x, x)$ is the periodicity function of the material, which modulates the function based on the wavevector and positon within the lattice.


Common Semiconductor Types

| Direct | Indirect |
|---|---|
| GaAs | Si, AlAs|  


## Variations of Energy Bands with Alloy Composition
As semiconductors are varied in their composition, their band structures change. An example of this is with GaAs and AlAs, where GaAs is a direct semiconductor and AlAs is a indirect semiconductor. If we transition a sample of GaAs into AlAs and measure the band gap energy as the compositon changes, we end up with the graph below.

![Band Gap Graph](Chapter_3/GaAs_AlAs_BandGap_Graph.png)

As we can tell, the GaAs sample has its conduction band minimum at $\Gamma$, which increases in its energy level as the Al concentration increases. If we continue adding Al, we eventually notice that the conduction band minimum switches to $X$, as $\Gamma$ continues at a much larger slope than $X$ does. This switch in minimum causes the change from a direct semiconductor to indirect semiconductor.

This feature of band gaps was discovered back in the early days of semiconductors. Scientists were testing different doping compositions and discovered that at some point the band gap energy changed very abrutly. This was due to the conduction band minimum moving from a direct location, to another indirect location.

# Charge Carries in Semiconductors

## Electrons and Holes
At 0K, all of the electrons in a semiconductor exist in the valence band, which leads to an empty conduction band. As thermal energy is added, electrons are excited from the valence band and moved into the conduction band, leaving holes in the valence band. Each pair of excited-electron and valence-hole are called *electron hole pairs* (EHPs).

An excited electron in the conduction band is relatively free to move around, as the number of energy states is much larger than the number of electrons. For example, with silicon at room temperature, there are around $10^{10}$ $\text{electrons}/cm^3$ in the conduction band, while the density of Si is around $10^{22}$ $\text{atoms}/cm^3$. The multiple orders of difference allows electrons to move freely and highlights the conductivity of semiconductors, in the view of the conduction band.

When looking at the current flow due to the holes, we have to change our view to look at the current density in the valence band. At 0K, when the valence band is full, the following equation describes the current density:

(4)
$$
    J = (-q)\sum^N_i{v_i} = 0
$$

This equation essentially says for every electron that is moving in a specific direction, there *must* be another electron moving the in the opposite direction. This is due to every energy state in the valence band being filled, and for the electron to move, it must occupy another, already filled energy state. The electron in this already filled state must then be ejected into another state, which then finds another filled state, leading to a chain reaction, or said in other words, leads to *zero net current flow*. The $E-K$ graph below shows some of this, as in the valence band, there will always be two electrons with opposite momentum at the same given energy level.

![EHP Momentum Pairs](Chapter_3/EHP_Momentum_EK.png)

If the semiconductor is brought above 0K, EHPs are created, leaving holes in the valence band. Equation 4 above transforms into the following, given that the $j^{th}$ electron is now missing:

(5)
$$
    J = (-q)\sum^N_i{(v_i)} - (-q)v_j
$$

If we rememeber that the summation is the same as equation 4, (5) changes to just the following equation:

(6)
$$
    J = -(-q)v_j = qv_j
$$

Rememebering that this describes the net current flow, we realize that equation 6 is actually saying that the holes have a *net positive current flow!* Now of course, this doesn't mean that the holes are actually moving current or have a positive charge, but actually what is happening is that an electron is filling the gap and "moving" the hole in the opposite direction. It remains to say though, that the general way of describing holes is that they have a positive charge and positive mass.

## Effective Mass
Electrons in a lattice structure are not considered completely free due to the complications the periodic potential brings to the wavefunctions. To use the regular electrodynamical equations on electrons within lattice structures, we must first find the *effective mass* of the electron, which depends on $E-k$ plot. We start by finding how the energy of en electron relates to its momentum, which also what spawns the shape an $E-K$ graph:

$$ 
    E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{p^2}{m} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}k^2
$$

From this equation, we can notice that the electron energy is parabolically related to the wavevector $k$, or said another way, the electron mass is inverse parabolically related to the energy. If we differentiate with respect to our independent variable, $k$, we arrive at the effective mass equation:

$$
    \begin{aligned}
    E &= \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}k^2 \\
    \frac{d^2E}{dk^2} &= \frac{\hbar^2}{m} \\
    m^* &= \frac{\hbar^2}{d^2E/dk^2} 
    \end{aligned}
$$

The equation shows us that the 2nd derivative, or the curvature of the band edge determies the effective mass. The graph below shows the E-K graphs for GaAs and AlAs and their lowest energy bands.

![Complicated E-K Graph](Chapter_3/GaAs-AlAs_E-K_Graph.png)

GaAs is a direct band gap material and AlAs is an indirect band gap material. Using the effective mass equation we found earlier, we can discern that the effective mass at the $X$ node is higher than that at the $\Gamma$ node for both materials. $\Gamma$ has a higher $\frac{d^2E}{dk^2}$ than $X$ does, which relates to a $\Gamma$ having a lower effective mass.

Looking further at this graph, we notice that if we calculate the effective mass for the valence band maximum (for electrons), that it is actually a *negative value!* Negative mass makes no sense, but if we remember that this is *effective* mass, it makes much more sense. Just viewing valence band electrons, this means that negative mass and negative charge electrons move in the same directon as positive mass and positive charge holes.

!!! note: Why calculate effective mass?
    Effective mass is a somewhat abstract concept and doesn't seem all that useful especially given the fact that it causes some complications, like negative mass. The reason why we find this value comes from Newton's Second Law:

    $$
        \frac{dp}{dt} = \frac{d(mv)}{dt} = F
    $$

    The above equation for an electron in a periodic crystal structure combines the internal and external forces; $F_{int} + F_{ext}$, where $F_{int}$ is the forces due to the period crystal structure and $F_{ext}$ is due to an external applied force. This problem is very difficult to solve for most semiconductors due to their completely different compositions from each other. It would be a waste of time to redo most of the same work to achieve different conclusions for each material. To work around this, we find the the band structure, $E-k$, for each material and relate what the *effective mass* of the particle would be for a given momentum. This simplification makes it easier to make general conclusions about semiconductors but also brings with it some issues where things like $\hbar k$ being a quasi-momentum or that effective mass needs to be treated differently in equations (summation, average, etc). Regardless of the issues, it comes to a net reduction of burden for calculation, so scientists stuck with it.

## Intrinsic Materials

An intrinsic material is a material with no defects or external additions (eg. not doped or contaminated). At 0K, an intrinsic material has zero electrons in the conduction band (zero EHPs) and a completely filled valence band. At higher temperatures, EHPs are generated and become the only charge carries in the material. The previous section 3.2.1 assumed an intrinsic material.

EHPs only are generated in pairs, therefore there must be an equal number of electrons in the conduction band and holes in valence band. This relationship is shown succinctly below:

$$
    n = p = n_i
$$ 

where $n$ is the number of *negative* electrons, $p$ is the number of *positive* holes, and $n_i$ is the *intrinsic* carrier concentration.

As the temperature varies, the EHP concentration must also vary. If we keep the carrier concentration the same, we realize that for every EHP *generated* we must have another EHP go through a *recombination*. These two rates, $g_i$ and $r_i$, for generation and recombination, respectively, can be related through the following equation:

$$ 
    g_t = r_t
$$

Given a specific carrier concentration, the rate at which EHPs are created must equal the rate at which EHPs are destroyed. This relation makes sense; if we created more EHPs then we destroyed, then we would no longer have $n = p$ and would no longer have an intrinsic material. We also realize that for an intrinsic material, this must hold true for all temperature (although the rates can vary) and we reach the following conclusion:

$$
    r_t = \alpha_rn_0p_0 = \alpha_rn_i^2 = g_t
$$

where $\alpha_r$ is a recombination factor that is determined by the mechanism that used to recombine the EHP. This relation tells us that the number of holes and electrons is directly proportional to the recombination and generation rates.

## Extrinsic Materials

Through specific processes, we can change the carrier concentrations in ways other than just temperature dependence. One of these ways is called *doping*, where other elements are added to the lattice structure. These new elements have different numbers of electrons then the main material of the lattice, which results in either extra electrons (n-type) or extra holes (p-type). When materials are doped such that $n_0$ or $p_0$ are different from $n_i$, the intrinsic carrier concentration, we call the material *extrinsic*.

### n-type Dopants

For n-type dopants, like those from column V (P, As, Sb), the extra atoms introduce a *donor* energy level, which resides just below the conduction band. This donor level is completely filled at 0K, but due to its proximity to the conduction band, electrons do not need much energy to move into the conduction band. Thus, at low temperatures, the donor level will be completely empty, and all of its electrons will exist in the conduction band. This causes $n_0$ to larger than $p_0$ as EHPs are still created with the temperature variance and the extra donor level does not contribute to the number of holes in the valence band. This donor band is shown in the image below.

![n-type Material](Chapter_3/n-type_material.png)

At 0K, all of the electrons in the donor level reside within the its energy level, but at low temperatures, like 50K, we see that electrons move into the conduction band. This means that $n_0 > p_0, n_i$.

### p-type Dopants

For p-type dopants, like those from column III (B, Al, Ga, In), the extra atoms introduce an *acceptor* energy level, existing just above the valence band. This energy level is normally empty, as the column III elements are misisng an electron when compared to the column IV main element. At 0K this band remains completely empty, just above the filled valence band. At low temperatures, the small energy difference between it and the valence band allows for electrons in the valence band to move into the acceptor level. This creates an extra amount of holes in the valence band. The image below shows the effect a p-type dopant has.

![p-type Material](Chapter_3/p-type_material.png)

At 0K, no electrons exist in the acceptor level, but at 50K, we notice many electrons leave the valence band to join the acceptor level. This causes the concentration to change, where $p_0 > n_0, n_i$.

!!! example: Doping Examples
    Doping Si with a column III element would be a p-type dopant, while a column IV element would be a n-type dopant. A combined III-V base semiconductor, like GaAs, gets donors from column VI, so S, Sc, and Te would be examples of substitutes for As. An acceptor for GaAs would reside in column II, so Be, Zn, and Cd would substitute for Ga. 

    A more odd example would be that of doping a III-V material with a column IV material, like Si or Ge. These column IV materials can act as donors or acceptors based on which atom location they reside in. For example, in GaAs, when Si resides in a Ga location, it acts as a donor, while on an As location, it acts an acceptor. These types of dopants are called *amphoteric*.

    Doping a material will cause changes in the electronic properties, which will be discussed later, but on a simple level, the following example demononstrates how powerful the process is. For Si, the intrinsic carrier concentration, $n_i$ is around $10^{10} \space\text{cm}^{-3}$ at room temperature. If Si is doped with As at a density of $10^{15} \space\text{atoms/cm}^3$, the resistivity drops from $2\times10^{5} \space\Omega\text{-cm}$ to $5 \space\Omega\text{-cm}$.

    When a semiconductor is doped, either electrons or holes will be much greater than the other. In either p-type or n-type, we describe the greater of the two as the *majority carrier* and the lesser the *minority carrier*. For example, in n-type the electrons are the majority carrier and the holes are the minority carrier. In p-type, the opposite is true.

## Electrons and Holes in Quantum Wells

**TODO: Write this section**

# Carrier Concentrations

Given what we now know about doping, carriers, and EHPs, we wish to find a way to mathmatically describe the carrier concentration. This is a quantum mechanical problem, and thus we must calculate over the entire region of allowed states for electrons (and holes). The following sections discuss this further.

## The Fermi Level

It is a known fact that electrons obey the Fermi-Dirac distribution when inside of a solid structure, like a lattice. Combining the quantum-mechanical nature of electrons (Pauli exlusion, wave nature, etc), we arrive at the following equation for the probability of an available energy state being filled:

$$
    \begin{equation}
    f(E) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{(E-E_f)/kT}}
    \end{equation}
$$

where $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, $E_f$ is the *Fermi level* of the material, $T$ is the temperature. This function, called the *Fermi-Dirac Distribution* will give the probability that the energy state, $E$, is populated with an electron, given the temperature is $T$. The Fermi level is the energy level at which no electrons can go above when the material is at 0K. This value is extremely important for describing semiconductor mechanics. 

An important observation to make about the Fermi level comes from when we set the energy in equation 3.3.1-1 to $E_f$, we find the following:

$$
    f(E_f)= [ 1 + e^{(E_f - E_f)/kT} ]^{-1} = \frac{1}{1+1} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

This specifically means that for any energy state equal to the Fermi level, the probability of finding an electron in that state, is always 50%, or .5.

A few more observations can be found by varying the value of $T$ and noticing the change in the shape of the Fermi-Dirac distribution. The below image highlights this experiment.

![Fermi-Dirac Distribution](Chapter_3/Fermi-Dirac-Distribution.png)

At 0K, the probability graph is a rectangular surface, where it makes a sharp decrease at the Fermi level. This graph perfectly lines up with the definition of the Fermi level, as at 0K, we will never find an electron above $E_f$. Increasing the temperature shows that the slope around $E_f$ will decrease, but stay centered at $E_f$. This also highlights the important aspect that as we add more thermal energy to the system, we should expect that some electrons will occupy higher level energy states, above the Fermi level.

If we were looking for the probability that a vacant energy state in the conduction band was filled, we would use $f(E)$, where $E$ is greater than the conduction band level. If we were looking for the probability that a hole exists in the valence band, we would use $1-f(E)$, where $E$ is less than the valence band energy. This can be seen in the graph above by looking at the smaller sections of the graph that are created by the changing temperature. If $T=0K$, then there is no shifting, and conduction band values are always $0$ and valence band values are always $1$

![Fermi-Dirac w/ Band Graph](Chapter_3/Fermi-Dirac-BandGraph.png)

Placing the Fermi-Dirac distribution on its side and overlaying on a simplified band gap diagram lets us see the differences between intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors and their carrier concentrations.

Looking at the intrinsic semiconductor, it is immediately noticed that the $E_f$ value is placed near the center of the band gap, which we would expect. An intrinsic semiconductor only creates conduction band electrons and valence band holes in pairs, or EHPs; meaning that there must be an equal number of holes and electrons. This causes the distribution to be centered in the band gap. If we look at the $f(E)$ values, where $E$ is above the conduction band or below the valence band, we notice that they would be the same. Again this lines up with the concept of EHPs.

For an n-type semiconductor, the $E_f$ value is shifted up. This correlates to the extra electrons in a n-type doped semiconductor, as the donor energy level would add more electrons above the orignally centered intrinsic $E_f$ level. Since the $E_f$ level is related to the probability of finding electrons at 0K, this action of shifting up the Fermi level with n-type semiconductors should make sense. 

We also notice in the image that due to the Fermi level being higher, the distribution is much closer to the conduction band, causing $f(E_c + \Delta E)$ values to be greater than that of $f(E_v - \Delta E)$, where $E_c$ and $E_v$ are the conduction and valence band energy levels, respectively, and $\Delta E$ is a shifting value that causes $f(E)$ to return the probability for the same relative distance from a band level. In other words, this above can also be said as the following: Given we energy levels at equivalent distances from the edge of the conduction band and valence band, we find the probabilities to not be the same.

Similar things can be said for p-type semiconductors; the Fermi level is shifted towards the valence band due to the acceptor level and the probability of finding a hole in the valence band ($1-f(E)$) is greater than the probability of finding an electron in the conduction band. The above formula also still works, with $\Delta E$, but just in the opposite effect.

## Electron and Hole Concentrations at Equilibrium

Given what we now know about how electrons are distributed in semiconductors, we now wish to find numerical values for the concentrations of electrons and holes. We find that the following gives us value for the concentration of electrons in the conduction band at equilibrium:

$$
    \begin{equation}
    \label{CarrierConcentration}
    n_0 = \int^{\infty}_{E_c} f(E)N(E)dE
    \end{equation}
$$

where $f(E)$ is the Fermi-Dirac distribution function, $N(E)$ is the density of states given an energy level, and $dE$ is a small section of the energy range. These three combined give an electron concentration for a small chunk of the energy band. Integrating over the entire conduction band give us the total electron concentration for that material. Density of states is a value derived from quantum mechanics and the Pauli exlusion principle, where its output is (states/$cm^3$).

Deriving the value for $N(E)$ gives the fact that the density of states is proportional to $E^{1/2}$. This then means that the distribution of states is high at $E_c$ and $E_v$, but quickly tapers off as $E$ moves further outwards (higher and lower, respectively). Given how the carrier concentration is derived above, we can determine the general shape of the electron and hole concentration for different types of semiconductors. The picture below demonstrates this.

![Electron and Hole Concentration based on different doped semiconductors](Chapter_3/Electron-HoleConcentration.png)

The intrinsic semiconductor has equal concentrations of electrons and holes, which we would expect, as $p_i$ and $n_i$ are equal at all temperatures for intrinsic materials. For n-type and p-type, the Fermi level is shifted up and down, respectively. This causes the carrier concentration to increase towards whichever direction it the Fermi level moved towards. For example, the p-type semiconductor has a much higher hole concentration then its electron concentration. The opposite can be said for n-type semiconductors.

If we were to simplify equation [CarrierConcentration] by introducing an _effective_ density of states, $N_c$, where $N_c$ is the density located at the conduction band edge, we would end end up with the following equation:

$$
    \begin{equation}
    \label{SimplifiedElectronCarrierConcentration}
    n_0 = N_cf(E_c)
    \end{equation}
$$

Equation [SimplifiedElectronCarrierConcentration] removes the integral by only looking at the band edge. The Fermi function $f_(E_c)$ can also be simplified by assuming $E_c$ is at least multiple $kT$ away from $E_f$,

$$
    \begin{equation}
    \label{SimplifiedElectronFermiFunction}
    f(E_c) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{(E_c-E_f)/kT}} \approxeq e^{-(E_c - E_f)/kT}
    \end{equation}
$$

Applying equation [SimplifiedElectronFermiFunction] to equation [SimplifiedElectronCarrierConcentration] arrives us at the following:

$$
    \begin{equation}
    \label{ElectronConcentration}
    n_0 = N_c e^{-(E_c - E_f)/kT}
    \end{equation}
$$

This simplified equation is much easier to use for finding the electron carrier concentration given the previous assumptions are true.

We can also arrive at the same conclusion for the hole concentration by changing $f(E_c)$ to $[1-f(E_v)]$,

$$
    \begin{equation}
    \label{SimplifiedHoleCarrierConcentration}
    p_0 = N_v [1- f(E_v)]
    \end{equation}
$$

$$
    \begin{equation}
    \label{SimplifiedHoleFermiFunction}
    1 - f(E_v) = 1 - \frac{1}{1 + e^{(E_v-E_f)/kT}} \approxeq e^{-(E_f - E_v)/kT}
    \end{equation}
$$

Applying equation [SimplifiedHoleFermiFunction] to equation [SimplifiedHoleCarrierConcentration] gives us the following:

$$
    \begin{equation}
    \label{HoleConcentration}
    p_0 = N_v e^{-(E_f - E_v)/kT}
    \end{equation}
$$

For intrinsic materials, we know that the Fermi level is not directly in the middle of the but instead at some level, $E_i$, near the middle of the band gap. From this we understand that equation [ElectronConcentration] and equation [HoleConcentration] become the following:

$$
    \begin{equation}
    \label{IntrinsicConcentrations}
    n_i = N_c e^{-(E_c - E_i)/kT}, \space p_i = N_v e^{-(E_i - E_v)/kT}
    \end{equation}
$$

We also know that for an intrinsic material, $n_i = p_i$, therefore the intrinsic concentration is

$$
    \begin{equation}
    \label{IntrinsicConcentration}
    n_i = \sqrt{N_cN_v} e^{-E_g/2kT}
    \end{equation}
$$

where $E_g$ is the band gap of the semiconductor.

The more important realization from equation [IntrinsicConcentration] and the previous equations is that the product of the electron and hole concentrations relates directly to the intrinsic concentration:

$$
    \begin{equation}
    \label{SimpIntrinsicConc}
    n_0 p_0 = n_i^2
    \end{equation}
$$

Given equation [SimpIntrinsicConc], a doping concentration and the intrinsic concentration, we can find the other unknown concentration. The intrinsic concentration is normally known for the material, which makes equation [SimpIntrinsicConc] extremely useful for many problems.

We also can simplify equation [HoleConcentration] and equation [ElectronConcentration] by using the above idea with the intrinsic concentration.

$$
    \begin{equation}
    \label{IntrinElectronConc}
    n_0 = n_i e^{(E_f - E_i)/kT}
    \end{equation}
$$

$$
    \begin{equation}
    \label{IntrinHoleConc}
    p_0 = n_i e^{(E_i - E_f)/kT}
    \end{equation}
$$

(###) Summary of Carrier Concentrations

The mess of equations given above all come from the idea of the carrier concentration being a summation of the combination between the density of states in a band and the Fermi function throughout that band. To simplify this, we introduced an _effective_ density of states, which does exactly what the effective mass does, allows us to find a value for the concentration at any point in the region of interest (the band diagram) by assuming a few key things, like the Fermi level's location. The imporant takeaways from above are the following:

1. Doping your material will shift $E_f$ and cause the concentrations to vary, where the image in this section shows the effect.
2. The Fermi level is not exactly in the center for intrinsic materials, but instead at some level $E_i$, nearby $E_f$
3. We can directly relate the electron and hole concentrations (at equilibrium) to the intrinsic concentration through equation [SimpIntrinsicConc].
4. The density of states equations increases by $E^{1/2}$ and the Fermi function results in a local max at $E_c$ and $E_v$ (within the bands), therefore, the maximum value for concentration is _not_ at the band edge, but instead just inside of the band. This can also be seen in the picture above.

The equations of importance are the following:

1. Eqn. [SimpIntrinsicConc] for finding either the hole or electron concentrations given you know the intrinsic concentration and one of the other concentrations
2. Eqn. [ElectronConcentration] and eqn. [HoleConcentration] given you know the Fermi level, the temperature, the band energy levels, and the effective density of states for the given band.
3. Eqn. [IntrinElectronConc] and eqn. [IntrinHoleConc] given you know the intrinsic concentration and the location of the intrinsic energy level and Fermi level.
4. Eqn. [IntrinsicConcentration] given you know _both_ $N_c$ and $N_v$ and the band gap, _OR_ you need to find the band gap given $N_c$, $N_v$, and $n_i$.
